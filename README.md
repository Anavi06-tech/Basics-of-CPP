ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview-

This repository contains two foundational C++ programs:

Hello World: Displays a welcome message.

Simple Calculator: Performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

ðŸ“š Theory-

C++ is a high-performance programming language derived from C, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. C++ is commonly used for system software, game development, and applications requiring high performance.

ðŸ§© Part A: Hello World-

Objective:

The "Hello World" program is a classic introduction to programming. It demonstrates how to display a message in the console using C++.

Key Concepts:

#include <iostream>: This library is necessary for input and output operations.

using namespace std;: This allows you to use the standard library functions without needing to prefix them with std::.

ðŸ§® Part B: Simple Calculator-

Objective:

This part of the project involves building a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

Key Concepts:

cin: Used to receive input from the user.

cout: Used to output results to the console.

Control Flow: This can be achieved using if-else statements or switch to decide which operation to perform based on user input.

ðŸ§  Conclusion-

These two basic programs introduce essential programming concepts:

Hello World: The first step in learning how to interact with the console and display output.

Simple Calculator: A hands-on exercise in handling user input, performing arithmetic, and using control flow statements (if-else).

Together, these programs provide a solid foundation for further C++ learning, including more complex data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented principles.
